# :warning: This script is under development :warning:

I'm developing this script to identify and determine the droplets sizes using the **OpenCV** module. But it is under development yet.

Currently it is capable of identifying droplets, like the ones showed in Fig. (1) and (2). In these figures the pinkish circles was identify using the Hough Circle Transform.
Right now I'm working to mitigate the false positive circles.

## Future features

When I'm done I hope the script could be capable of:

- Identify and determinate the droplets diameters
- Process a bunch of images
- Automatilly calculate the number of masks applied to image after a input information

## Future goals
- Use Machine Learning to do it all alone
